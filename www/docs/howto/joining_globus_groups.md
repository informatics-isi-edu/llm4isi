This page describes how to get editing/viewing access to project data and compute resources by joining the correct
Globus group.

**NOTE: We only use Globus for authentication, not for file or data management.**

## Step 2: Choose how to log in

When you click the link, you will see a Globus login page where you may choose your identity provider. Choose one of the
following and follow the prompts:

* Your institution’s credentials
* Google
* ORCID iD

If none of the above options are available to you, click where it says "Then use Globus ID to sign in." to choose your
own username/password and follow the instructions.

**NOTE:** If you see a page like the screenshot below and have an account you've used before with Globus, go ahead and
click "Link to existing account". If not, click "No thanks, continue."

## Step 3: Request group membership

Once you’ve signed in, click the “Join Group” button (towards the right side of the page) to request membership. There
will be a short form to fill out. Please fill out all fields.

You will then receive an email notification that your membership is pending.

**Once the administrator approves your application, you’ll receive email confirmation that your membership has been
approved.**
