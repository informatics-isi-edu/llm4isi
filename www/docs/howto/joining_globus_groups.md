This page describes how to get editing/viewing access to project data and compute resources by joining the correct Globus group.

**NOTE: We only use Globus for authentication, not for file or data management.**

## Step 1: Join the correct group

Click on the appropriate link below to request joining that group:

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| [project-readers](https://app.globus.org/groups/<globus_reader_group_guid>/about) | Read only access to project data.                            |
| [project-writers](https://app.globus.org/groups/<globus_writer_group_guid>/about) | Read and write access to project data and compute resources. |
                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
## Step 2: Choose how to log in

When you click the link, you will see a Globus login page where you may choose your identity provider. Choose one of the following and follow the prompts:

* Your institution’s credentials
* Google
* ORCID iD

If none of the above options are available to you, click where it says "Then use Globus ID to sign in." to choose your own username/password and follow the instructions.

**NOTE:** If you see a page like the screenshot below and have an account you've used before with Globus, go ahead and click "Link to existing account". If not, click "No thanks, continue."

## Step 3: Request group membership

Once you’ve signed in, click the  “Join Group” button (towards the right side of the page) to request membership. There will be a short form to fill out. Please fill out all fields.

You will then receive an email notification that your membership is pending.

**Once the administrator approves your application, you’ll receive email confirmation that your membership has been approved.**
